This folder contains the Python scripts for the demand models developed in this study, as well as sample data for executing the codes. Please make sure you set up the environment before running the code.

The "Reduction_Daily_Demand.ipynb" file is used to develop the percent reduction in daily demand models. Explanatory variables of the model are listed in the code, and you can run it using the "ReductionDailyDemandSample.csv" file.


The "Direct_Demand_Model.ipynb" file is used to develop the direct demand (origin-destination-pair) models. Explanatory variables of the model are listed in the code, and you can run it using the "DirectDemandSample.csv" file.
